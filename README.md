## What is this project?
Have you ever watched Lo-fi youtube channel in your late night coding session such as Chilled Cow? This is a Youtube Channel that has around 10 million subscribers. Many people spend their nights listening to this channel, not only for its nicely curated musics, but also the vibe that this cover art gives out. 

### What is the purpose of your website:  
For my final project, I decide to create a website that uses Javascript library THREE.js to create a 3 dimensional immersive experience for users. The name of the project is called “In My Room”. I chose to use three.js and WebGL to create a space for people to vibe with. This hopefully can be a website that exists on programmer’s side screen, and accompanies them through their journey. When they don’t have inspiration, they can just stare inside the different models. 

### What Information do you convey with your website: 
In My Room has a unique retro+futuristic aesthetics like no other spaces. I created this space based on my own room, and added sprinkles of imagination throughout the space. You can hover around and look at details of the models, and you can simply choose the preset angle facing towards the beautiful landscape. The color contrast of outside and inside gives out a cozy feelings to the user. 

### How is it interesting and engaging: 
User can self direct to find interesting angle in the room. They can also tweak the day/night ratio to get to a comfortable setting. It provides full control over the color scheme inside. 

I imagine this website in the future to have more customizability, such as mounting your own playlist, choosing music to play on the turntable, and play small games on the arcade machine. I also imagine to have more animation/outside view to look at, to make the who experience more fun. However, at this stage, I modeled everything in the room, and self taught how to use opgl to write shaders.
